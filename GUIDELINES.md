# Experiment management - Guidelines

These guidelines should serve as a reference for the management of experiments in the context of the project. They are meant to provide a structured approach to the planning, execution, tracking, and evaluation of experiments, as well as to ensure that the results are reproducible and can be used to draw meaningful conclusions.

The planning phase is mostly on the researcher and architect to define the goals, validation metrics, and methodology of the experiment. In this phase, it is also expected to define the dataset and if necessary the dataset request that should be forwarded to the client.
